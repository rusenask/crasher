## The storage volume used by each Pod in the StatefulSet. If a
## persistentVolume is not enabled, the Pods will use `emptyDir` ephemeral
## local storage. Setting the storageClass attribute to "-" disables dynamic
## provisioning of Persistent Volumes; leaving it unset will invoke the default
## provisioner.

## A StatefulSet requires a headless Service to establish the stable network
## identities of the Pods, and that Service is created automatically by this
## chart without any additional configuration. The Service block below refers
## to a second Service that governs how clients connect to Crasher.
